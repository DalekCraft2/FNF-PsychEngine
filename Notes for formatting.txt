I'm really nitpicky about code conventions.
https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/code-style/

-Order of keywords: 
    override
    public/private
    static
    inline

-Order of fields:
    static fields before instance fields
    public fields before private fields
    normal variables before properties

-Getters and Setters for properties at the end of class, as they should always be private.

-Comments should only be used when one can not find a way to express something through code
    My own note on this: Try to not comment out code, because it can become outdated very quickly,
    and will be unclear to the user whether it is meant to be uncommented optionally.
    For example, at the time of writing this, the Gitaroo easter egg is commented out in PlayState, but is described as being optional.
    Try to instead use conditionals in those situations.

-Try to use "final" instead of "var" if the variable is meant to be a constant (in which case, it is by definition not a variable).

-Enum names are always all-uppercase (I do the same with static constants because Java).
-All other variables must be lowerCamelCase.

Once I find documentation for the hxformat.json file, I'm putting the link in here.
