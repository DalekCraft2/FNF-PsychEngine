General To-Do stuff

- Catch up on merging new commits from Psych Engine; I am currently working on this commit: https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/commit/d8936d6720a66fc5dfc65057ea71a086dcc426ed
- Don't use conditionals to hide public variables and functions because that's sort of shitty API design
- I hate kebab-case and lack of standardization. I'm going to make every file's and folder's name use snake_case lIkE mInEcRaFt 
- Staaage editor~
- Add Mock documentation to the docs folder and update the existing documentation
- Maybe only use single quotes when string interpolation is being used
- Change some Traces to be logged as Info instead
- Open an issue on HaxeFlixel GitHub about the disappearing cursor bug
